    - title: Student Researcher
      institution: UCLA Prof. Bolei Zhouâ€™s Group
      year: 2022.3 - Present
      description:
        - Currently developing an improved version of the Human-in-the-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL). The trained agent can master driving tasks in less than 30 minutes on a home PC, saving more than 90% of the training time compared to traditional RL methods such as SAC, using Python(PyTorch).
        - Developing more photorealistic simulation environment for training RL autopilot agent using Unreal Engine 4 and Microsoft Airsim.

    - title: Student Researcher
      institution: UCLA Structure-Computer Interaction Lab
      year: 2020.6 - 2022.6
      description:
        - Developed a 2D LiDAR robotic navigation algorithm for a road identification system and improved the navigation accuracy by 30% (compared with multi-Ransac) for the robot while maintaining a low cost (less than $100). The road identification system was deployed on a low-cost autonomous weed-control agri-robot, using C++ and Python.
        - Created an inverse learning approach to train a model to generate the physical parameters (such as diameter) for the soft robot and increase the efficiency of collecting the parameters by 90%, using Python (Tensorflow).

      institution: UCLA Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics
      year: 2020.6 - 2022.6
      description: 
        - Processed RNA sequence data and performed PCA, data visualization and other data analysis on it, using Python and R.
        - Proved that Low-coverage RNA sequencing is an effective approach in Expression quantitative trait loci studies and can save the cost by more than 50%.
