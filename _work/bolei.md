From 2022.3 to present.

At Prof Bolei-Zhou's group, I mainly focused on developing human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning methods. More about this work will be shown later, after our paper upen review.

We also developed scenarionet: open-source platform for large-scale traffic scenario simulation and modeling

I also developed a more photorealistic simulation environment for training RL autopilot agent, using Unreal Engine 4 and Microsoft Airsim.
