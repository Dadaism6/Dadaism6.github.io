2020.6 - 2022.6

This is actually the first research lab I joined in my undergraduate. Genuine thanks to Prof Roel Ophoff and Toni Boltz :) 

I mainly perform basic data processing and analysis tasks (seems trival, but experiment->result->analysis->design new experiment is the core for Biology, at least in my opinion). I processed RNA sequence data and performed PCA, data visualization and other data analysis on it using Python and R. 

I co-authored a paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666247722000197?via%3Dihub">“Powerful eQTL
mapping through low-coverage RNA sequencing”</a>. We Proved that Low-coverage RNA sequencing is an effective approach in Expression quantitative trait loci studies and can save the cost by more than 50%.

I feel a little regret, as I should have participate more on the Bio direction, instead of only do the things I know. But, still, I learned a lot from my first research experience!
