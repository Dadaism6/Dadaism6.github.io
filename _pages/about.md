<h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">About me</h2>
Hello! I'm Chenda Duan, `a second-year MS student in Computer Science at UCLA`, previous interning as a `Machine Learning Research Engineer` at Kuaishou Technology this summer. I recently graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from UCLA, proudly with a perfect `4.0 GPA`.

üîç **Actively Seeking Opportunities**:
- **PhD opportunities** focusing on Multi-modal Learning, RL, AI for Medicine/Bio, and general AIGC.
- **Full-time roles** as a Machine Learning Engineer, Software Engineer, or Quant Researcher in the US.

If you believe there's a potential fit, please [contact me](mailto:chenda@ucla.edu). I'm eager to explore new challenges and collaborations.

<h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">About my academics.</h2>

The field of computer science is vast and ever-evolving. Within this expansive domain, it is hard to constrain yourself into a specific area of interest. I am a firm believer in the power of interdisciplinary research and the importance of a broad skillset. I am passionate about the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. I am also very interested in the application of machine learning in the field of Biology, Medicine, and Economics.

**Research Interests**:
- Reinforcement Learning
- Multi-modal Learning (Vision-language)
- AI for Medicine, Computational Bio
- Robotics


At UCLA, I've been privileged to collaborate with three prominent research teams:

**Research Groups**:
- UCLA Prof Bolei Zhou'S Group
- UCLA's Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics.
- UCLA Structures-Computer Interaction Lab.
