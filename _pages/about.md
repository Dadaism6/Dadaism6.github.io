Hello! I am Chenda Duan, an first-year MS student at UCLA CS. I currently intern as a machine learning research engineer @ Kuaishou Technology.

Previously, I just graduated from UCLA with B.S Computer Science. I maintained a `perfect 4.0 GPA` during my undergraduate! 


I am broadly interested in ML (RL), CV, ML, Robotics, and other interdisciplinary fields. I am also a quick learner and an active developer. If you find anything you would like to know about, please feel free to contact me! I am willing to have a chat with anything! `You can find my contact info and other social media at the bottom of the page`.

` I am actively looking for PhD opportunities with the focus on RL or AIGC! I am also actively looking for full time opportunities for Machine Learning Engineer | Software Engineer | Quant Researcher located in US! Feel free to contact me via email if you found my background suited for the position!`

I participated in three research teams at UCLA. I work on designing human-interactable and human-controllable reinforcement learning methods at Prof Zhou's group. I investigate methods to make a robust robot (including soft robot and agricultural robot) using variety CV and ML methods at the Structures-Computer Interaction lab. And I also worked on eQTL mapping and other things related to bioinformatics at UCLA Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics.
