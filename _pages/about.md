üîç **Actively Seeking Opportunities**:
- **2025 Summer Internship** as a Research Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or Quant Researcher in the US.

If you believe there's a potential fit, please [contact me](mailto:chenda@ucla.edu). I'm eager to explore new challenges and collaborations.

<h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">About me</h2>
Hello there! I'm Chenda Duan, `a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at UCLA`, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Vwani Roychowdhury](https://www.vwaniroychowdhury.com/). I earned both my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from UCLA as well, conducting my master's research under the guidance of Prof. [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/). During my bachelor's studies, I had the opportunity to work with Prof. [M. Khalid Jawed](https://structures.computer/) and Dr. [Roel Ophoff]. I am a 10-year UCLA Bruin!

My current research lies at the intersection of `AI` and `Medical Neuroscience`. I am particularly focused on applying machine learning techniques to address medical conditions such as epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease, aiming to develop innovative solutions for diagnosis and treatment.

Additionally, I am working on `vision-language/multi-modal models`, with a specific focus on achieving performance comparable to SOTA models like GPT-4 and Gemini for long-horizon video understanding, using regular-sized VLMs and LLMs.

My previous research experience includes work in `autonomous driving, reinforcement learning, and robotic`.

<h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">About my academics.</h2>

The field of computer science is vast and ever-evolving. Within this expansive domain, it is hard to constrain yourself into a specific area of interest. I am a firm believer in the power of interdisciplinary research and the importance of a broad skillset. I am passionate about the intersection of machine learning, medical science/neurosicence, computer vision, LLMs, and robotics.

**Research Interests**:
- AI for Science
- LLM, VLM, LMM
- Reinforcement Learning
- Robotics


At UCLA, I've been fortunate to collaborate with three prominent research teams:

**Research Groups**:
- UCLA Prof Vwani Roychowdhury's Group
- UCLA Prof Bolei Zhou'S Group
- UCLA's Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics.
- UCLA Structures-Computer Interaction Lab.
